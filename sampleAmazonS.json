I spent $400 on it. Called the manufacturer, hoping to get a replaced powerhead as I have had Dysons in the past and the powerheads always seem to go. I\u2019ve had two replaced by myself purchasing them. The manufacturers phone number is US after waiting over half an hour on hold. I get told no I have a Canadian product with a serial number that\u2019s Canadian. I said well before I get you off the line let\u2019s check the serial Number, it was not a Canadian serial number. It\u2019s a US serial number she put me on hold again not knowing how to deal with this. Came back on and told me I still need to call the Canadian line as she can do nothing to help me with this issue and I said, but your number is the one used as a manufacture, phone number and who to contact with issues. She didn\u2019t really care that\u2019s the phone number and that I am to call Canadian phone lines for Dyson and perhaps I shouldn\u2019t have bought it off of Amazon and gone directly to a Dyson dealer??? I just want my Hedd replaced for the defective product I just bought", "This vacuum is terrible! Had it less than two weeks and already stopped working. The battery last less than 10-12 mins on high.
